# Layout Description Framework
Layout Description Framework or LDF is a framework to help semi-custom or full-custom designers create the layout of their ICs by writing C# code. LDF would make it much easier for designers to change the design and also would help them to automate the custom design process. It is also possible to integrate the LDF with other tools (e.g. Physical Design tools) in the near future.
